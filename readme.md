### A graphics & animation library for Typescript.

**sharc**, short for **Sh**apes and **A**nimations **R**endered on a **C**anvas, is an object-oriented Typescript library that aims to make using the HTML Canvas API simpler and faster. It features:
 - graphics primitives like lines, rounded rectangles, bezier curves, text, and more
 -  a `Stage` class that handles the animation loop for you
 - shape nesting to build complex structures
 - pointer event detection relative to a sprite's scaling, rotation, transformation
 - a robust animation system that lets you add several animations to a sprite in a single line of code
 - a vast properties system that makes modifying sprites a breeze
 - type-safety!
